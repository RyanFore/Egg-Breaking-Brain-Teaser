# Egg-Breaking-Brain-Teaser

This program was written to empirically test the theoretically calculated solution of a brain teaser. Details of the brain teaser including its solution can be found in the the file named "The Setup". The math used to obtain the theoretical optimum values is found in the "Math" file, as handwritten, mostly legible equations

When the user is asked to input the desired number of eggs and stories to be used in setting up the brain teaser
The optimal interval choices and the number of drops required in the worst case are then shown, followed by the theoretically obtained optimum interval values
